# Project 1: Drink Drank Drunk

### Overview

'Drink Drank Drunk' is my project which aims to determine which beer is the most favoured by the users of the website. DDD is my website, developed via Rails, that has users sign up and rate beer that they have consumed; the site will then provide an average and rank the beers accordingly from highest to lowest to determine which beer is truly the best.

### End Report

While I found difficulty due to the scale of the project (Multiple models, confusing relationships etc.) *most* things that I aimed to implement were achieved. Confusion still remains in certain spots of Rails development and databases but practice makes perfect I guess.
